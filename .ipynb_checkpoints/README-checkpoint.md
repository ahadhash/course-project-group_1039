## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is a list of baby name in the US collected by the US government. The data is collected based on the US Social Security application and covers all the baby names up to 2015. The goal of the dataset collection is to keep track of the trend of baby naming.

There are two sets of data, one at national level and the other is at state level. At state level, the records started from 1910 and 2-digital state code is being used to represent each state. National baby record starts from 1880 and covers until 2015. Only baby name occurred five times in the same year or state are included in the dataset for the privacy purposes. The dataset includes the baby name, gender, year of birth, state code (at state level), and occurrence of the name. The dataset is sorted first on the sex, then year of birth and occurrence of the name in descending order.
