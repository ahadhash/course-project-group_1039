## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We chose this US baby name dataset as it is interesting to see the naming trend at a specific region throughout the 100 years.  This dataset collected baby names both at states and national level in the US from 1990s to 2014. We will analyze the state level dataset and compare the most and least popular baby names in each state to see the similarity. The national level dataset will also be analyzed to see if there is a naming trend over the 100 years. This can be done by comparing the most popular boy/girls name in each decade. Ultimately, we can compare both the state and national level datasets and see which state has the most similar naming trend to the national trend. 

Certainly, there are other variables we will analyze to ask specific questions: The boys and girls name can be analyzed separately, and the naming trend for a specific time period can also varies based on our interest. The user-facing Dashboard will be used to present our analysis for this exciting dataset. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is a list of baby names in the US collected by the US Social Security Administrator. It covers all the baby names up to the end of 2014. The goal of the dataset collection is to keep track of the trend of baby naming.

There are two sets of data, one at national level and the other is at state level. At state level, the records started from 1910 and 2-digital state code is being used to represent each state. National baby record starts from 1880 and covers until 2015. Only baby name occurred at least five times in the same year or state are included in the dataset for the privacy purposes. The dataset includes the baby name, gender, year of birth, state code (at state level), and occurrence of the name. The dataset is sorted first on the sex, then year of birth and occurrence of the name in descending order.
